# microservices_learning-zipkin_sleuth_configServer_RabbitMQ

This project currency converter is an application that enables the easy conversion of currency values based on the exchange rates. 
The intention to create this microservices is to implement what I learnt today:
                                                              I.   Zipkin
                                                              II.  Sleuth
                                                              III. Spring Cloud Config Server
                                                              IV.  RabbitMQ
                                                              
Thanks.
